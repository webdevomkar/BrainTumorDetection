# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using Image Processing

This project demonstrates a simple pipeline for detecting brain tumors in MRI images using classical image processing techniques with OpenCV.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to detect potential brain tumors from MRI scans by applying:
- Grayscale conversion
- Thresholding & inverse thresholding
- Morphological operations
- Edge detection (Canny)
- Contour detection

The processed images are displayed in a 2-row grid layout, with each image labeled for better visualization and understanding of each step.

## 🖼️ Sample Output

The output window displays a grid of 8 images showing the transformation from the original MRI scan to detected contours highlighting the tumor region.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Convolutional Neural Network
